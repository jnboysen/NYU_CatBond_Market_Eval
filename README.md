## NYU MSBA Final Paper
# Research and Evaluation into the Catastrophe Bond Market

As part of the NYU MSBA program, I worked with a team of five students to leverage ML to improve the transparency and pricing of Catastrophe Bonds coming to market. Our work included:

•	Undertake data acquisition, data preparation and detailed exploratory data analysis to develop our business and domain understanding.
•	Investigated a variety of regression-based ML techniques to create a suite of robust models in R using hyperparameter optimization, cross-validation and regularization.
•	Interactive web based UX for prospective analysts and investors in R and Shiny which can collect data, invoke and track predictions, provide comparative analytics and serve interactive data visualizations.
